PQC signature using
OpenQuantumSafe.org liboqs-java library
SIG algorithm: Falcon-1024

*** generate a key pair for signer ***
generated private key length: 2305
generated public key length:  1793
private and public key for signer saved to file

* * * sign the plaintext with the private key * * *
signature length: 1266 data: in a separate file

* * * verify the signature against the plaintext with the public key * * *

signature is verified: true
