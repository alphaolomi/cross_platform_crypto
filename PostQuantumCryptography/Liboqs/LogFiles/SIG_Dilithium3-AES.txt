PQC signature using
OpenQuantumSafe.org liboqs-java library
SIG algorithm: Dilithium3-AES

*** generate a key pair for signer ***
generated private key length: 4000
generated public key length:  1952
private and public key for signer saved to file

* * * sign the plaintext with the private key * * *
signature length: 3293 data: in a separate file

* * * verify the signature against the plaintext with the public key * * *

signature is verified: true
