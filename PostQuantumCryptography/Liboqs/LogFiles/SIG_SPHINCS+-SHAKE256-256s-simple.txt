PQC signature using
OpenQuantumSafe.org liboqs-java library
SIG algorithm: SPHINCS+-SHAKE256-256s-simple

*** generate a key pair for signer ***
generated private key length: 128
generated public key length:  64
private and public key for signer saved to file

* * * sign the plaintext with the private key * * *
signature length: 29792 data: in a separate file

* * * verify the signature against the plaintext with the public key * * *

signature is verified: true
